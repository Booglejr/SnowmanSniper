# Contribution Guidelines
We would be happy to have you contribute to our project. Here are the ground rules:

1) Only tabs.
2) Separate functions and components belong in separate files and folders with clear and concise names.
3) Code should be tested before it is merged.
4) Lastly, you should have fun. After all this is your personal time.
